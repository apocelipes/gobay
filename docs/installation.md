## Docker development box

If any of the installations above is too annoying in your OS, you may try this option:

After creating your new project (checkout the quickstart.md page), there will be a `dockerfiles` directory in your project.

open it, and run `sh run.sh`, it will build a development ready docker image, and run a docker container with the project directory mounted.
